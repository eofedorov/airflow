# Agent Behavior

- **Default mode: analysis-only for questions.** Answer with analysis and understanding, not implementation.
- **Provide concise answers.**
- **Do not modify files or run commands** unless the user explicitly instructs to implement changes.
- **Do not ask for confirmation** unless the request is ambiguous.
